        Immersing myself in the captivating worlds of manga and comics is one of my favorite pastimes. 
        Exploring diverse narratives and unique art styles has become a delightful escape and a continuous 
        source of inspiration.

        Expressing creativity through art is a cherished hobby of mine. Whether it's through the precision 
        of digital tools or the tactile feel of traditional mediums, sketching allows me to bring ideas and 
        emotions to life on the canvas.
        
        Playing Games:
        Gaming is not just a form of entertainment for me; it's a way to unwind, explore different virtual 
        realms, and occasionally challenge my strategic thinking. From immersive story-driven experiences to 
        competitive gameplay, the world of games offers a dynamic and engaging escape.
        
        Coding Mini Projects for Personal/Family/Work CIP:
        As a coding enthusiast, I enjoy working on mini projects that serve practical purposes. Whether it's 
        automating tasks for personal efficiency, creating tools for family use, or contributing to Continuous 
        Improvement Projects (CIP) at work, coding allows me to blend my passion for technology with real-world 
        applications.
